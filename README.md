A/B Testing Projects
Welcome to my repository dedicated to A/B testing projects! Here you will find various projects related to conducting and analyzing A/B tests that I have developed during my learning journey and professional experience.

About the Projects
Each project in this repository represents an A/B testing investigation aimed at assessing the effectiveness of changes and making informed decisions based on statistical analyses. During development, I utilized the following tools and skills:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
Statistical Analysis: Z-tests, t-tests, confidence intervals
Visualization: graphs, charts, data distributions
Repository Structure
Each project resides within a separate directory and contains the following elements:

Jupyter Notebook: An interactive notebook with code, data analysis, and visualizations.
Data: A folder containing the source data used in the project.
